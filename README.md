Build a Website using an API with HTML, JavaScript, and JSON


o build a weather report website using an API, HTML, JavaScript, and JSON, we will integrate an external weather API, such as OpenWeatherMap, which provides weather data in JSON format. Below is a step-by-step guide with the complete source code for building a weather report website.
Steps:

    Get API Key: You need an API key from OpenWeatherMap to access the weather data. Sign up at OpenWeatherMap and get your free API key.

    Create HTML Structure: This will include fields to enter the city name, a button to fetch the weather, and a section to display the results.

    Fetch Weather Data using JavaScript: Use JavaScript to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and display it in the HTML.

    Handle JSON Data: Parse the returned JSON data and dynamically update the HTML to show the weather report.
